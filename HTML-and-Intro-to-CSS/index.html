                    <p>JavaScript is amazing, it is a programming language most often used in web development. But
                        whatever
                        kind of programming you do on the web,whether you work with Java or C# or python, if you make
                        any
                        kind
                        of
                        web based application its important to know JavaScript </p>
                    <p>You can make a simple function in JavaScript, like '<code>function hello(){
    console.log("hello")}</code>', or whole entire web applications, so much is possible with just html, css and
                        JavaScript!</p>

                    <p>My dream is to become a so called 'end to end' developer, someone who knows everything from ui/ux
                        design
                        to
                        front end development to backend development to fullstack development to cloud and devops. And I
                        hope
                        that
                        this education will help me get my foot in the door of the IT industry!</p>
