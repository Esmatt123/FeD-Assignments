	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Why I love programming</h1>
  <p>Programming is like <em>Lego</em>, you can put pieces together to make a little digital machine going</p>
  <p>You get to be creative and logical, two skills that are very useful in your career and day to day life.</p>
  <p>With <abbr>HTML</abbr> you get to structure websites, with <abbr>CSS</abbr> you get to give styling to your html, <abbr>CSS</abbr> has thousands of different features <br /> and alone can take a lifetime to master, even if its beginner friendly.</p>
  <p>JavaScript is amazing, it is a programming language most often used in web development. <br /> But whatever kind of programming you do on the web,whether you work with Java or C# or python, if you make any kind of web based application its important to know JavaScript </p>
  <p>You can make a simple function in JavaScript, like '<code>function hello(){
    console.log("hello")}</code>', or whole entire web applications, so much is possible with just html, css and JavaScript!</p>
    <p>My dream is to become a so called 'end to end' developer, someone who knows everything from ui/ux design to front end development to backend development to fullstack development to cloud and devops. And I hope that this education will help me get my foot in the door of the IT industry!</p>
